# ROYIN Dictionary Parser
Parser for CSV file from ROYIN Thai-Thai dictionary. Part of research under CTFL (Center for Thai as a Foreign Language) Internship with Professor Nattanun Chanchaochai. 

## What is this parser for?
This program is written as part of making a Thai learner's textbook. The main idea is to identify words that are essential for learners and rank its difficulty based on definition. This model is similar to the [CEFR] (https://www.englishprofile.org/wordlists/evp) (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages).
As part of the research, we classified vocabulary words based on frequency using the [Thai National Corpus] (https://www.arts.chula.ac.th/ling/tnc3/) and the [Thai national dictionary] (https://dictionary.orst.go.th/).
